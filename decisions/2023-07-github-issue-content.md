# GitHub Issue Content

* **Status:** Agreed
* **Last Updated:** 2023-07
* **Objective:** Have GitHub issues that don't rely on linked content

## Context & Problem Statement

Very often we will have created content in apps like Google Docs, and it
can seem convenient to link to that content. Unfortunately this means that
the GitHub Issue doesn't make sense on its own, and sends the reader on a
'treasure hunt' to find the full context.

For people who aren't on the staff of Atsign they'll often not be able to
access linked resources due to authentication requirements.

## Goals

Have GitHub issues that make sense on their own, without having to explore
linked content.

Enable contributors to our open source projects to see the full context
rather than having it hidden behind authentication.

## Summary

Content should be copied into issues wherenever it's of suitable size and
can be shared in the open.

For verbose content it may make sense to provide a summary and a link to
the original source, or a summary and a copy in a gist (or other freely
available resource).

If there are concerns about sharing proprietary data then think carefully
about where to open the issue in terms of public versus private repos.
